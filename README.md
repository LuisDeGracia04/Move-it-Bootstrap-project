# Move-it-Bootstrap-project
This website was created using mostly bootstrap ( from Angela's course), with the intention to develop my knowledge on this fantastic and useful feature. Bootstrap will be really useful to save time in urgent scenarios where a quick website must be made, on the other hand it could also be used as a place to look for layouts and reference.
